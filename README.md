# Data Mining Project 
Repository for storing the Data Mining project for the NOVA IMS master course (academic year 2021/2022)

## Objective
As a Data Mining/Analytic Consultant, we were asked to develop a Customer Segmentation in such a way that it
will be possible for the Marketing Department to better understand all the different Customersâ€™ Profiles. 
We were are expected to define, describe and explain the clusters you chose and simultaneous, express the marketing approach you recommend for each cluster.
